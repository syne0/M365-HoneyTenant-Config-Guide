# M365-HoneyTenant-Config-Guide
## Purpose
The purpose of this guide is to detail some recommendations and best practice for configurations when setting up a Microsoft 365 tenant as a honeypot.
It details the settings required to lock the tenant down as secure as possible, but also provides some examples where settings may need to be adjusted to let the honeypot function, and how you can still keep things relatively secure.
## Disclaimer
Don’t screw up. Don’t play around if you don’t know what you're doing and aren’t prepared for the consequences. Do not tie your honeypot tenant to your dev or prod tenant. Don’t put in similar domains, send emails between them, etc.
